/**
 * Data.java
 *
 * This class represents the data being stored in the cache.
 *
 * While the main data being stored is a character, we use this object
 * so we can also include meta data that will help implement a
 * cache scheme, like whether or not the Data is currently in the cache,
 * when it became cached, and how often it is requested.
 *
 * This class also includes before and after pointers to Data objects,
 * making it the basis of a doubly-linked list.
 *
 * This class implements the Comparable interface, which means that
 * outside this class one can add Data to a priority queue or describe one Data
 * as "less than", "greater than", or "equal to" another.
